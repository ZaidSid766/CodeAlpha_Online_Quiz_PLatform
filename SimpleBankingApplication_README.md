# Simple Banking Application

## Overview
The Simple Banking Application is a basic Java program that allows users to perform essential banking tasks such as depositing money, withdrawing funds, checking their account balance, and exiting the program. It features a user-friendly, text-based interface and is designed to be simple and functional.

## Features
- **Deposit Money**: Securely deposit any positive amount into your account. Invalid amounts are not accepted.
- **Withdraw Money**: Withdraw funds provided the requested amount does not exceed your current balance. Overdrafts and invalid inputs are prevented.
- **Check Balance**: View your current account balance anytime for real-time updates.
- **Exit Option**: Safely exit the application with a confirmation message.

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to choose an action:
   - Press `1` to deposit money.
   - Press `2` to withdraw money.
   - Press `3` to check your balance.
   - Press `4` to exit the application.
3. Enter valid inputs as prompted.

## How It Works
The program uses Java's `Scanner` class for input handling and employs loops and conditionals to execute user actions. It ensures smooth interaction by handling errors and invalid inputs gracefully.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

## How to Run
1. Compile the `SimpleBankingApplication.java` file using the command:
   ```
   javac SimpleBankingApplication.java
   ```
2. Run the compiled program using:
   ```
   java SimpleBankingApplication
   ```

## Ideal For
- Beginners learning Java programming.
- Educational purposes to practice control flow, input validation, and error handling.

## Future Improvements
- Adding user authentication.
